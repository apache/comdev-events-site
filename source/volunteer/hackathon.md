title: Hackathon Coordination
---

Hackathons are hands-on collaborative events where developers work together on Apache projects.

A hackathon coordinater works with representatives from projects likely
to have a presence at event to help them think about what they might
work on, and publicize this work to the project community and the
audience of the event.

They'll also work with the planners of the event to create a space with
the necessary components (tables, power outlets, signage, etc) to make
that space welcoming to participants, including beginners.

## What you'll be doing

(You don't have to do all of this work yourself - find several friends
to do this with you!)


### Before the event

* Identify project communities likely to be present at the event
* Find someone in each of those communities to own their particular part
  of the space.
* Encourage those communities to identify specific tasks or topics that
  they will work on during the event
* Report periodically to planners@apachecon.com how the work is going

### During the event

* Ensure that there are adequate power outlets at the tables (You may
  need to coordinate volunteers to bring these, depending on what the
  venue provides.)
* Place signage around the space to indicate what communities will be
  working there at a given day or time.
* Be a contact for support requests
* Direct participants to the right table.

### After the event

* Update this page with suggestions or other things you learned during
  the event.
* Report to planners@apachecon.com about the attendance and if anything
  notable was accomplished
