title: University and Educational Outreach
---

Apache projects offer valuable learning opportunities for students and educators across many disciplines. University outreach volunteers help connect Apache communities with educational institutions at all levels.

## Outreach Opportunities

University outreach volunteers should be local to the event venue, and
familiar with local educational institutions.

We engage with multiple departments and programs:

* **Computer Science** - Software development, open source practices, distributed systems
* **Legal Studies** - Open source licensing, intellectual property, foundation governance
* **Business** - Community management, project governance, open source business models
* **Design** - User experience, visual design, accessibility
* **Other Disciplines** - Technical writing, marketing, communications, and more

## What Outreach Volunteers Do

* Connect with faculty and student organizations
* Create simple posters targeted at each audience
* Create more detailed landing pages for each audience, describing what
  they might get out of the event. Note that many students will be
  unaware of the ASF, but familiar with some of the individual projects,
  or open source in general
* Put up posters or fliers at local colleges, universities, and
  high schools.
