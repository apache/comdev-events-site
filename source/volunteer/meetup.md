title: Meetup Outreach
---

Reaching out to local meetup groups is a great way to get a larger
audience to our events, and serve the local technical community. As a
meetup outreach coordinator, you'll be identifying those meetup groups,
and getting the word out to them.

Volunteers should be local to the event venue.

## What Meetup Outreach Involves

* Identify relevant local meetup groups
* Build relationships with local tech communities
* Look for related topics, like legal, business, and communication,
  which may be interested in open source and Apache projects
* Share information about Apache events with meetup communities
* Encourage meetup participants to submit talks for the upcoming event

## Types of Meetup Groups you might conenct with

We can engage with various types of groups:

* Language-specific meetups (Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
* Technology-focused groups (cloud, data, web development)
* Open source and community groups
* General developer meetups

## Get Involved

If you're active in local meetup communities or have experience organizing meetups, your help would be valuable. Join us on the [apachecon.slack.com](https://s.apache.org/apachecon-slack) Slack instance to volunteer.
