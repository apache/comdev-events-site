The Apache Software Foundation events program relies on volunteers to help make our events successful and welcoming. Whether you have a few hours or want to take on a larger role, there are many ways to contribute.

We welcome volunteers of all experience levels and backgrounds!
You do not need to be an Apache member, committer, or an expert on any
particular Apache project to volunteer for these task.

Join the **#volunteers** channel on the [apachecon.slack.com](http://s.apache.org/apachecon-slack) Slack instance to connect with other volunteers and stay updated on opportunities.

## Volunteer Categories

We have volunteer opportunities in several areas. (This is not an
exhaustive list. If there's something you see that's not being done,
please come talk to us about it.)

* [Hackathon Coordination](hackathon.html) - Help organize and run hackathons at Apache events
* [University Outreach](university.html) - Connect with colleges and universities across multiple departments
* [Meetup Outreach](meetup.html) - Engage with local meetup groups about upcoming events
* [Speaker Support](speaker-support.html) - Provide coaching and feedback to speakers
