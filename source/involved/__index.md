title: Getting Involved in Apache Events
slug: index

There are a number of different ways to get involved with Events at Apache.
Many of these come under the umbrella of the Conferences Committee, but
some fall under different groups, such as the
[Apache Community Development Project](https://community.apache.org/).

If you are an Apache Committer, and you're interested in putting on an
Apache Event, please see the [Organising Events](/organize/index.html)
section for more help. If you are interested in helping others out with
putting on an Apache Event, you are advised to join the appropriate
[mailing list](mailing-lists.html), and volunteer for events there.
This could be for a project specific event, such as a Hackathon or
Meetup, for a foundation wide event, such as a BarCamp or Retreat,
or a larger event such as a Roadshow or a Project / Project Cluster
related small conference.

If you are interested in putting on an external event making use of
Apache Brands and Marks, please see the
[Third Party Event Branding Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html)
for information on the approval process and requirements.

If you are interested in speaking about Apache at external events, then please see
[Apache Speakers Resources](https://community.apache.org/speakers/index.html) that are
maintained by the [Apache Community Development Project](https://community.apache.org/).

If you are putting on an external event, and would like a small number of
speakers for it to talk about Apache Projects and Technologies, please see the
[Apache Speakers Resources](https://community.apache.org/speakers/index.html) for
information on finding speakers.

If you are putting on an external event, and you are interested in
having an Apache track, or an Apache barcamp / hackathon style event,
please contact
[ConCom, the Conference Committee](https://www.apache.org/foundation/conferences.html)
to discuss the possibility.

If you are interested in attending an Apache Event, or an Apache
related event, please see the [Calendar](/event/calendar.html) to discover
what is coming up.
