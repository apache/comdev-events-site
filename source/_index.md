The ASF runs and participates in a number
of events related to our Apache projects throughout the year. These events have three main purposes:

 * Educate the world about the work and mission of the ASF
 * Provide technical information about our many Apache projects
 * Build developer and user communities

Running a third party or project event? You must comply with the [events
branding policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events).

The [ASF Travel Assistance Committee](https://tac.apache.org/) provides financial
assistance for selected ASF events, to those who would otherwise be unable to attend them.
