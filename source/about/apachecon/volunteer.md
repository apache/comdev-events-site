# Volunteer to help at ApacheCon

Coordination of ApacheCon happens on two lists:

 * The private planners@apachecon.com mailing list for most of the
   planning work
 * The public apachecon-discuss@apache.org mailing list for general
   discussion, calls for volunteers, announcements, and so on.

At this time, we can use help in the following areas - typically for each ApacheCon that happens.
 To volunteer, please send email to the *apachecon-discuss* mailing list indicating your availability.

## Calls For Papers

The CFP for each ApacheCon draws hundreds of submissions about projects all
around the ASF.  We always need volunteers who can show up **on time**
when the CFP closes to help rate talks and schedule specific tracks.
Many Apache PMCs are now managing their own tracks or co-located events
at ApacheCon, which is great.

## Promotions and Publicity

While the ApacheCon Planners work with VP, Marketing & Publicity for some
basic services, we always could use Apache committers retweeting and
amplifying the official notices about conferences.

Follow [@ApacheCon](https://twitter.com/apachecon) and [@TheASF](https://twitter.com/apachecon), and help spread their message about upcoming events.

## Website

  * Keep this `events.apache.org` [website source code updated](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/concom/site/trunk/content). Possibly make it look better.
  * Work with Infra and the planning team to improve the site design.
  * At the end of the event, archive the current event information to the past events area, and start the new event section.

## Hackathon Coordinator

  * Alert projects that a hackathon is available for each conference. Encourage them to
    have a plan ahead of time as to what they'll work on
  * Make signs for the various tables
  * Welcome people and help them find the community that they're looking for

##  Local interest

Preferably someone that lives local to the venue: Update the website to indicate what the local attractions are - restaurants, beaches, bars, dance venues, and so on. Update content in wiki, and work with Producer to update the main event website.

## "Meet the experts" coordinator

Identify people that can participate in a "meet the experts" area. Determine what this entails. Coordinate scheduling of this event with Producer and VP Conferences. Promote the event.

## Lightning Talks

  * Write up web page defining the lightning talks
  * Promote the lightning talks to our community
  * Work with LightningTalk MCs to pre-register volunteers that want to speak<
  * (Maybe) find an organization that wants to sponsor this event and
    work with Producer to determine the nature of the event and when it will be
