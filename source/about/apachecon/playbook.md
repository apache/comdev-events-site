title: ApacheCon playbook
---

This playbook is focused at ApacheCon or Roadshow volunteers who are
actively involved in planning and running Apache events.  Please be sure
to bring your questions to the planners@ mailing list!

# What to do before, during, and after an Apache event

This is a set of recommended actions that an event organizer may do
before, during, and after ApacheCon.

Many of the recommendations in here can, of course, be applied to any
Apache event or Roadshow, including third-party events, or project events run by
PMCs.

If you do these things, you gain the benefit of promotion from the
larger Apache community. Also, these are based on our experiences
running ApacheCon.

This is a work in progress - please feel free to make suggestions!

## Before You Start

Review the Event Branding Policy and secure permission for any
events not produced directly by the ASF or its contracted producer(s).
If you are an Apache PMC running your own event, please review the
policy to ensure you're presenting the best face for ASF brands.

## Planning Topics To Cover

* Venue requirements/considerations
    * Attempt to select venue and date prior to the previous event, so
      that it can be announced from stage a year in advance
    * BarCamp - having an extra shoulder day before/after the event, with space for group discussions
    * Hackathon - central space with power and network, and round tables
      for group collaboration
    * Wifi - reliable 200+ Mb/s. ApacheCon attendees expect fast wifi. Preferred info: 'apachecon'/'httpd1995'
    * Hard network drop in keynote room for streaming video. Hard
      network drop for reg desk.
    * Room for media training - consult with [ASF Marketing & Publicity](//www.apache.org/press/#contact)
    * Board room for monthly board meeting (if the conference falls [during board meeting](//www.apache.org/foundation/board/calendar)). Consult with
      secretary@apache.org

* Communication
    * Notify members@, commiters@ and all dev@ and users@ lists of an
      upcoming event.  **Note special procedures** for committers@ and dev/users@ addresses.
    * Notify all PMCs that there is space available for project summits - if they can provide curated content by deadline.
      Work from scarcity (ie, only 4 rooms available!) rather than
      making this appear to be a free-for-all that people can wander
      into later on.

* Marketing Coordination
 - Coordinate with M&P to create, publish, and update event-specific promotions on ASF social media channels including Twitter, LinkedIn, and LinkedIn Showcase page (affiliated page).

 - Establish budget for paid digital ad campaign for Roadshows three months before date of event.

 - Coordinate with M&P to research spend options, negotiate rate, and secure media buy for digital advertising campaigns for Roadshows.

 - Coordinate with M&P/Central Services to create artwork for online promotions and digital ad campaigns.

* CFP
    * Ensure the CFP system is working before announce
    * Blog post on blogs.apache.org

    * Review talks within timeline set by producer. Provide producer with list of
      accepted, rejected, and waitlisted talks in a schedule format.
    * Come up with a list of desired keynotes. Invite those that you may
      know personally and circle producer in on anyone that confirms.
    * Prepare slide template to send to speakers with talk acceptance
