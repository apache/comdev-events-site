The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) runs, or participates in some fashion in,
a number of different types of events, which different target audiences and goals, to educate about our
projects and about the Foundation, and to build the communities.

The main types of event we work with around ASF projects are:

  - [Community Over Code](/about/commcode/index.html) - the ASF's official conference
  - [Roadshows](/about/roadshow.html) - bringing ASF content around the world
  - [Endorsed events](/about/endorsed.html) - run by third parties using Apache brands

If you want to organize your own event that uses ASF brands or trademarks in any way, we strongly encourage you to
[coordinate with us](/organize/index.html).
