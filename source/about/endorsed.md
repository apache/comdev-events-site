# Apache endorsed/approved events

There are many third-party events produced every year that focus on
Apache Software Foundation projects. The ASF encourages these events, as
they expand the reach of our projects and our message.

If you are producing an Apache-related event, and using our brands and
marks, we ask that contact us for our official approval. Along with
this, we will also help promote these events, where possible and
appropriate. Whether or not you want to collaborate with us on your
event, you MUST adhere to our [branding policy](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html).
