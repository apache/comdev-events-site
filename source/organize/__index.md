If you want to host your own Apache project event, or propose a
[roadshow](/about/roadshow.html) about the ASF, get in touch with us on the [Event Planning
mailing list](mailto:planners@apachecon.com).

**Important!** While we appreciate other parties producing events to tell the world about
our many great Apache projects and communities, [Apache trademarks and brands](https://whimsy.apache.org/brand/list)
are also important to us.  To use any Apache trademarks in conjunctions with events,
you **must** request permission by following the
[Third Party Event Branding Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html).
