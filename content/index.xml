      <description>Apache Roadshows are small regional one- or two-day events, intended to build local community and educate about what the Apache Software Foundation does.
While not a traditional roadshow (ie, a traveling event with multiple stops), we use the name to indicate that there may be multiple small events on a particular continent. Thus, the Europe Roadshow may have small events in Berlin and Barcelona during the course of a year, while the North America Roadshow might have events in DC and Chicago.</description>

      <description>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) runs, or participates in some fashion in, a number of different types of events, which different target audiences and goals, to educate about our projects and about the Foundation, and to build the communities.
The main types of event we work with around ASF projects are:
Community Over Code - the ASF&amp;rsquo;s official conference Roadshows - bringing ASF content around the world Endorsed events - run by third parties using Apache brands If you want to organize your own event that uses ASF brands or trademarks in any way, we strongly encourage you to coordinate with us.</description>

      <description>Community Over Code (formerly ApacheCon) is the official conference of the Apache Software Foundation. Its primary goals are education and community building. We try to produce one each calendar year somewhere in North America and Europe, and are working on expanding this to the rest of the world.
If you want to volunteer to help with Community Over Code, please join our mailing lists, and see what volunteer opportunities we have, bearing in mind that it sometimes gets out of date.</description>

      <description>Apache endorsed/approved events There are many third-party events produced every year that focus on Apache Software Foundation projects. The ASF encourages these events, as they expand the reach of our projects and our message.
If you are producing an Apache-related event, and using our brands and marks, we ask that contact us for our official approval. Along with this, we will also help promote these events, where possible and appropriate. Whether or not you want to collaborate with us on your event, you MUST adhere to our branding policy.</description>

      <description>There are a number of different ways to get involved with Events at Apache. Many of these come under the umbrella of the Conferences Committee, but some fall under different groups, such as the Apache Community Development Project.
If you are an Apache Committer, and you&amp;rsquo;re interested in putting on an Apache Event, please see the Organising Events section for more help. If you are interested in helping others out with putting on an Apache Event, you are advised to join the appropriate mailing list, and volunteer for events there.</description>
