      <description>Apache Roadshows are small regional one- or two-day events, intended to build local community and educate about what the Apache Software Foundation does.
While not a traditional roadshow (ie, a traveling event with multiple stops), we use the name to indicate that there may be multiple small events on a particular continent. Thus, the Europe Roadshow may have small events in Berlin and Barcelona during the course of a year, while the North America Roadshow might have events in DC and Chicago.</description>

      <description>Community Over Code (formerly ApacheCon) is the official conference of the Apache Software Foundation. Its primary goals are education and community building. We try to produce one each calendar year somewhere in North America and Europe, and are working on expanding this to the rest of the world.
If you want to volunteer to help with Community Over Code, please join our mailing lists, and see what volunteer opportunities we have, bearing in mind that it sometimes gets out of date.</description>

If you are an Apache Committer, and you&amp;rsquo;re interested in putting on an Apache Event, please see the Organising Events section for more help. If you are interested in helping others out with putting on an Apache Event, you are advised to join the appropriate mailing list, and volunteer for events there.</description>

      <description>Hackathons are hands-on collaborative events where developers work together on Apache projects.
A hackathon coordinator works with representatives from projects likely to have a presence at event to help them think about what they might work on, and publicize this work to the project community and the audience of the event.
They&amp;rsquo;ll also work with the planners of the event to create a space with the necessary components (tables, power outlets, signage, etc) to make that space welcoming to participants, including beginners.</description>
